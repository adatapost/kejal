Java SE Platform
==============================================


The Java SE is bundle of :

    1. Java Languages and other tools
    2. Java Core API -- Or -- Java TYPES system
    3. Java Runtime Environment -- JRE

 and this bundle is called Java Software Developer Kit -                                                        JDK.


About JDK installation
=======================

Normally, JDK installed under C:\Program Files\Java folder (however you can change it at the time of installation) with jdk.version.numer folder.

 This "jdk.version.number" folder is called JAVA_HOME.

You may find following folders in JAVA_HOME:

 1. bin -- It includes javac.exe (Java compiler)
                       java.exe (Java Launcher - It starts                                   the JRE Services)
                       and other tools.

 
  In order to compile your .java code files from anywhere
  (any folder) within the machine, add this path to "Path"
  environment variable.

  What is "Path"?

    The "Path" is called environment variable and it 
    contains folder path which contains executables     (.exe,.bat, .com) and one path is delimeted with ; (semi-colon) to another path.

     e.g

     Type "Path" command at command prompt to see the
     existing path.


     To set "Path" permenent
     =========================
      1. Right Mouse on My Computer + Properties
      2. Select Advanced tab +  Click on "Environment Vars"
      3. Do not add,delete,edit the "System variables".
         We must have to create "User" environment vars:

          Click on New button to add new var:
             Name : Path
             Value : c:\Program Files\Java\jdk.x.x.x\bin


    When we type something and press enter at "command" prompt, the operating system will make a search for entered command in folder locations defined in "Path" env variable.

     If given "command" is found then OS will execute it      or display error-message otherwise.


2. lib  --- folder include Java Archive Files (JAR) which             is a "zip/compressed" file and it contains
            classes (Datatypes), resources (images) and
            source code.

            .jar files are called library files or dynamic
            link library file.

3. jre  ---- This folder contains "runtime" environment to
             assist the OS to run your Java program.

4. src.zip  --  Src.zip file contains source code of java
                core API.


The Java Language
========================================================

The "Java" language is :

    1. Case-sensitive
    2. Statically typed 
    3. Object-oriented
    4. General-purpose 

         programming language whose applications are 
         managed (controlled) i.e start, exected, stopped
         by the JRE-JVM.

    5. Syntax is borrowed from C++.

    6. Java Language is developed via Java Language        Specification (JLS) --- a document which provide
       guideline for the people so they can develop Java
       compiler.

         There are number of "companies" have their own
         Java compilers -- including google, Apache, IBM,
         etc.

     7. Java Language, Java APIS,Java Runtime Environments         and other platforms are developed using "GUIDELINE -- also called specificiation" so any person wish to develop his/her own platform, language, lib must have to strictly follow the "Guideline". And that is why Java Technologies are "Open Source".


What is "Statically typed"?

  Languages have ability to examine program code at the time of compilation is called "Statically typed".


  And some languages have ability to examine program code
  during execution is called "Dynamically typed".


   Java, C# are example of "statically" typed languages.

   JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python are example of "dynamic"    languages.



  for example, this code cannot be executed in C# as well as Java:

    int a;
    a++;

  Both; Java & C# compiler will complaint that there is no   such value in "a" to increment.
