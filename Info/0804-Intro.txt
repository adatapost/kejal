What are the roles of programming languages?
=======================================================

1. It provides syntax (grammar).

2. It allow us to write or type the code to instruct the
   operating system and its system softwares.

3. Language "translate" program code  into "native" or
   "operating system" or "platform" instructions.



 e.g

   C/C++ Program => Compiled and Translated => To OS                                                instructions

   Java Language
   program       => Compiled and Translated => To Java
                                               platform 
                                               instructions
                                                  ||
                                                  \/                                                  Java platform
                                          Compiler
					  translates 
					  it to OS 
					  instructions.
                                                 ||
                                                 \/
                                               To OS
                                             Instructions

What is Platform/Framework?
========================================================

The framework/platform is a programming environment (software tools) which is installed upon the OS i.e started with operating system and expose operating system's functionalities via "DataTypes" (or system-level and high-level classes).


  OR

 1. It is installed upon the OS (There are different      versions of platform for different operating systems).

 2. It provides the best "approach" to expose the
    underlying functionalities from operating system.

 3. These functionalities is available to developer in form     of classes, interfaces, enums (Different DataTypes in     Java).

    Java Platform's "Data Types" are designed using an     Object-Oriented Paradigm (approach/methodology).


Java Platforms
============================================
There are three Java Platforms:


1. Java Standard Edition (Java SE) which contains:

         1. Java Language
         2. Java Core API (essential datatypes)
         3. Java Runtime Environment (JRE)

    This is general purpose "Platform" and number of     specific purpose platforms are developed especially -     Java EE, Java ME, and Android using it.
   
2. Java Enterprise Edition (Java EE) which contains:

          1. Web Technologies - Servlet, JSP, EL, JSTL
          2. Mail API (Application Programming Interface or
                       classes)
          3. EJB APIs etc

3. Java Micro Edition (Device Platform) which contains:

          1. Device Runtime Environment
          2. DataTypes or classes
