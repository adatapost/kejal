Java Language Basics
==============================================

1. Java Source code file

   ========================================

   The Java source code must have .java extension
   and it contains :

      1. Only one top-level "public" class/interface/enum          per .java file.
      2. One or more non-public class/interface/enum.

   
   The .java file contains number of class definitions and    thats why it is called "Compilation" unit.


 [ Note : Always create .java file in your own folder.]
 [      e.g c:\kejal\day1>notepad FileName.java       ]

       3. Java file name must be typed as "PascalCase"           format -- i.e Capitalize the first letter of
          each word.

             e.g

              HelloApplication.java
              Employee.java
              ClassRoom.java
      4. Class (DataType) names must be typed as          "PascalCase".

         e.g

            class StudentEnroll 
             {
              }
             class BankAccount {}
      5. local variable, field name, method (function) name
         must be written in "camelCase" --- lowercase the
         first word and then capitalize first letter of          each word.
 
          e.g

            int rollNo = 10;

            String firstName = "Patel";
 
            String localAddress = "12-Abc";

            double monthlySalary = 20000.22;

            void doWork() { }
            int getAmount() { }
            void setAmount() { }
            

     Above guideline (rules) are optional but we must
     follows this guideline to learn & develop an      "Industry" standard applications.


     Example : Create First.java (Compilation Unit) and
               add following class definitions:

          First.java
         =============================

         class HelloApplication {}
         interface TestIt {}
         enum MyFriend {}


         Now, compile these classes,

            >javac First.java

          This command will creates three  .class files
          called "Java-byte code" files --- 
 
                1. HelloApplication.class
                2. TestIt.class
                3. MyFriend.class


      Example:   Defining the "public" class
 
          
      It is important to note that the top-level 
      "public" class name must be same as "FileName.java"       or vice-versa.

        So Java compiler issue error while compiling          following code:

            First.java
            =============
            public class HelloApplication {}

              Error says that the "HelloApplication" must               be declared in "HelloApplication.java".

     So you can rename First.java to HelloApplication.java

              Or

     change the class name "First" 
               e.g public class First {}
