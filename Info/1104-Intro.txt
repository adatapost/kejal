Important packages of Java Core API
===================================================
Following package names are reserved for "Java Core APIS" or Java Platforms.

  1. java
  2. javax

 These names -- java and javax -- must not be used
                                  to create user-defined
                                  datatypes or classes.

  
 "java" package and its sub-packages
  ----------------------------------

   1. java.lang   -- This is "primary" or "main" package of                      Java core API and it includes :
                        Wrapper classes
                        Classes to print output on screen
                        Classes to load another classes
                        Thread classes
                        Exception classes

                   -- This is the only package in Java that
                      will be "imported" automatically in
                      our program. 

                       We can use any class/type from this
                       package without qualifying or 
                       importing a package.

                       The Java compiler automatically 
                       insert "java.lang" package in our
                       code.


    What is the meaning of "Importing a package"?
     =============================================

      Importing a package means to inform the Java Compiler       or JRE about location/position of class.
 
      In which location the class is available is called 
      "import".

               e.g

                   To use "Date" class in program, we must
                   have to specify the location of Date                    class.
                    e.g

                          java.util.Date
                       So "Date" class is located at                        "java.util" package.

     What is "fully qualified" class name?

         Date <--- is not fully qualified name and                    sometimes it creates ambiguity because
                   there are two Date classes in Core APIs.

         java.util.Date  and
         java.sql.Date 

                
    2. java.util   ---- It contains :

                        1.  DataStructure classes - Linked
			    List, Stack, Tree, Map etc.
                        2.  Date, Time and Calendar
                        3.  Misc classes - Random,Scanner                             etc

    3. java.io     --- It contains device independent
                       Input & Output classes.

    4. java.text   -- It contains "Number", "DateTime",                        "String" formatting classes

    5. java.net    -- It contains "NetWork" classes

    6. java.sql    -- It contains "Database programming"
                      classes

    7. java.awt    -- It contains Graphical User Interface
                      System classes -- Drawing, images
                      etc.

         and there are number of other sub-sub packages
         under these packages.


  "javax" package 
  ================================================

  "javax" package name describes an "extension/additional"
   APIS.

    1. javax.swing  --- It is developed using 'java.awt'
                        and provide classes to develop
                        Windows Application.

    2. javax.xml    --- To parse/read the XML documents.
                        (It extends the java.io and other                          APIS)
    3. javax.sql    --- It extends java.sql classes to
                        create new classes that will be                         used in JavaEE app.
